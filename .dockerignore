# Don't ignore model files needed by the backend. Only ignore model artifacts in notebooks/datasets if you want to keep image small.
# If you have very large model files inside notebook/ that you do NOT want to copy into the image, add explicit paths such as:
# backend/notebook/some-large-model.h5
# For safety we don't include a global "*.h5" pattern here.
